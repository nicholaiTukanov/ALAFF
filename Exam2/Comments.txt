Regarding number of iterations and time taken to converge:

Method of Steepest Descent - Took 6700 iterations and ~10 sec 
Method of Steepest Descent with ichol - Took 603 iterations and ~1 sec
Conjugate Gradient - Took 98 iteration and ~0.5 sec
Conjugate Gradient with ichol - Took 43 iteration and ~0.07 sec

(These numbers are without any fancy tricks when computing ichol. When using
fancy tricks, I can get each method that uses preconditioning down to 1 iteration.)

Observations:

- SD without ichol takes longer than with ichol.
- CG is much faster than SD.
- Similar to SD with ichol, CG with ichol is faster than CG.
- Decreasing the tolerance in the struct makes it so that PCG converges faster.

End comments:

- From the experiments, it seems clear that having search directions that are 
linearly independent (CG) is better.
- It is also clear that using a preconditioner, decreases the number of iterations.
